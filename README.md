A wine list slider. The project is written with ReactJS and native JS. Run the following lines to run the project.

## Run Native Javascript

Web-Security protections of browsers do not allow local file operations. Possible solutions are server or framework based. A little trick is needed to overcome this.

 For **Windows:**
1.  `Windows + R` or `Start Menu --> Run`
2.  Execute the following command:
```
chrome.exe --user-data-dir="C://Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security
```
For **Mac:**
1. Go to terminal
2. Execute the following command:
 ```
open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --user-data-dir="/var/tmp/Chrome dev session" --disable-web-security
```

## Run ReactJS

### `npm install`

Install to the ReactJS libraries.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
